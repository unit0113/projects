    # Output layer activation is specific to the output layer 
    'output_layer_activation':     'sigmoid',  # Options are [relu, sigmoid, tanh, linear, leaky_relu]
    # Hidden network architecture describes the number of nodes in each hidden layer

    # Number of directions the snake can "see" in

    ## Mutation ##

    # Mutation rate is the probability that a given gene in a chromosome will randomly mutate
    'mutation_rate':               0.05,       # Value must be between [0.00, 1.00)
    # If the mutation rate type is static, then the mutation rate will always be `mutation_rate`,
    # otherwise if it is decaying it will decrease as the number of generations increase
    'mutation_rate_type':          'static',   # Options are [static, decaying]
    # The probability that if a mutation occurs, it is gaussian
    'probability_gaussian':        1.0,        # Values must be between [0.00, 1.00]
    # The probability that if a mutation occurs, it is random uniform
    'probability_random_uniform':  0.0,        # Values must be between [0.00, 1.00]

    ## Crossover ##
    
    # eta related to SBX. Larger values create a distribution closer around the parents while smaller values venture further from them.
    # Only used if probability_SBX > 0.00
    'SBX_eta':                     100,
    # Probability that when crossover occurs, it is simulated binary crossover
    'probability_SBX':             0.5,
    # The type of SPBX to consider. If it is 'r' then it flattens a 2D array in row major ordering.
    # If SPBX_type is 'c' then it flattens a 2D array in column major ordering.
    'SPBX_type':                   'r',        # Options are 'r' for row or 'c' for column
    # Probability that when crossover occurs, it is single point binary crossover
    'probability_SPBX':            0.5,
    # Crossover selection type determines the way in which we select individuals for crossover
    'crossover_selection_type':    'roulette_wheel',

    ## Selection ##

    # Number of parents that will be used for reproducing
    'num_parents':                 500,
    # Number of offspring that will be created. Keep num_offspring >= num_parents
    'num_offspring':               1000,
    # The selection type to use for the next generation.
    # If selection_type == 'plus':
    #     Then the top num_parents will be chosen from (num_offspring + num_parents)
    # If selection_type == 'comma':
    #     Then the top num_parents will be chosen from (num_offspring)
    # @NOTE: if the lifespan of the individual is 1, then it cannot be selected for the next generation
    # If enough indivduals are unable to be selected for the next generation, new random ones will take their place.
    # @NOTE: If selection_type == 'comma' then lifespan is ignored.
    #   This is equivalent to lifespan = 1 in this case since the parents never make it to the new generation.
    'selection_type':              'plus',     # Options are ['plus', 'comma']

    ## Individual ##

    # How long an individual is allowed to be in the population before dying off.
    # This can be useful for allowing exploration. Imagine a top individual constantly being selected for crossover.
    # With a lifespan, after a number of generations, the individual will not be selected to participate in future
    # generations. This can allow for other individuals to have higher selective pressure than they previously did.
    # @NOTE this only matters if 'selecton_type' == 'plus'. If 'selection_type' == 'comma', then 'lifespan' is completely ignored.
    'lifespan':                    np.inf,          # Options are any positive integer or np.inf (typed out as if it were a number, i.e. no quotes to make it a string)
    # The type of vision the snake has when it sees itself or the apple.
    # If the vision is binary, then the input into the Neural Network is 1 (can see) or 0 (cannot see).
    # If the vision is distance, then the input into the Neural Network is 1.0/distance.
    # 1.0/distance is used to keep values capped at 1.0 as a max.
    'apple_and_self_vision':       'binary'    # Options are ['binary', 'distance']
