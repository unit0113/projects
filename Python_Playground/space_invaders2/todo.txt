design patterns
wave factory->enemy factory->movement profile factory + weapon factory + shield factory + fire behavior factory
Fixed level mode vs random level mode
Camera shake: trauma^2, trauma ~= percentage health taken
State stack: title, game, store
weapon animations
different player ships/stats
pre/post level animations
score screen animations

movement behavior has canFire flag
Movement behaviors: straight down, zig-zag, omega shape, pause near top then travel down, mirror player, swarm boid (weight * path_following_steering + weight * boid_steering)
Fire behaviors: random/interval, single-fire, double tap, burst (encapsulate in one behavior class?)
primary weapons: standard, big/slow, gatling, beam
secondary weapons: fan, rockets, guided missile, swarm missiles
bomb, bomb upgrades (capacity, damage, AOE)
power ups

particle effects on hits/deaths
utlities (turret, mines, activatable shield battery, repair bots, bomb fabricator, increase fire rate/damage (turbo mode), absorb shield dmg to reload)
