Despite their pervasiveness, these models -- including those implemented by top tech companies -- suffer from tremendous amounts of algorithmic bias. The seminal work of [Buolamwini and Gebru](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v81/buolamwini18a/buolamwini18a.pdf) provided an approach and benchmark dataset to evaluate facial analysis algorithms, revealing startling accuracy discrepancies across skin tone and gender demographics.\n",

Second, it requires that we know what potential biases (e.g., race, gender, pose, occlusion, hats, glasses, etc.) to look for in the data. As a result, manual annotation may not capture all the different sources of bias and uncertainty that may exist.\n",

We then sample a noise value $\\epsilon$ from a Gaussian distribution, and then scale it by the standard deviation and add back the mean to output the result as our sampled latent vector. Formalizing this for a latent variable $z$ where we sample $\\epsilon \\sim N(0,(I))$ we have:\n",
