        "\n",
        "To achieve this it is critical to be able to identify and diagnose issues of bias and uncertainty in deep learning models, as we explored in the Facial Detection Lab 2. We need benchmarks that uniformly measure how uncertain a given model is, and we need principled ways of measuring bias and uncertainty. To that end, in this lab, we'll utilize [Capsa](https://github.com/themis-ai/capsa), a risk-estimation wrapping library developed by [Themis AI](https://themisai.io/). Capsa supports the estimation of three different types of ***risk***, defined as measures of how robust and trustworthy our model is. These are:\n",
        "1. **Representation bias**: reflects how likely combinations of features are to appear in a given dataset. Often, certain combinations of features are severely under-represented in datasets, which means models learn them less well and can thus lead to unwanted bias.\n",
        "2. **Data uncertainty**: reflects noise in the data, for example when sensors have noisy measurements, classes in datasets have low separations, and generally when very similar inputs lead to drastically different outputs. Also known as *aleatoric* uncertainty. \n",
        "3. **Model uncertainty**: captures the areas of our underlying data distribution that the model has not yet learned or has difficulty learning. Areas of high model uncertainty can be due to out-of-distribution (OOD) samples or data that is harder to learn. Also known as *epistemic* uncertainty."
