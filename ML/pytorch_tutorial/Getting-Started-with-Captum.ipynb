    "# Getting Started with Captum\n",
    "\n",
    "[Captum](https://captum.ai/) (“comprehension” in Latin) is an open source, extensible library for model interpretability built on PyTorch.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the increase in model complexity and the resulting lack of transparency, model interpretability methods have become increasingly important. Model understanding is both an active area of research as well as an area of focus for practical applications across industries using machine learning. Captum provides state-of-the-art algorithms, including Integrated Gradients, to provide researchers and developers with an easy way to understand which features are contributing to a model’s output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Full documentation, an API reference, and a suite of tutorials on specific topics are available at the [captum.ai](https://captum.ai/) website.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Captum's approach to model interpretability is in terms of *attributions.* There are three kinds of attributions available in Captum:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Feature Attribution** seeks to explain a particular output in terms of features of the input that generated it. Explaining whether a movie review was positive or negative in terms of certain words in the review is an example of feature attribution.\n",
    "* **Layer Attribution** examines the activity of a model's hidden layer subsequent to a particular input. Examining the spatially-mapped output of a convolutional layer in response to an input image in an example of layer attribution.\n",
    "* **Neuron Attribution** is analagous to layer attribution, but focuses on the activity of a single neuron.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this interactive notebook, we'll look at Feature Attribution and Layer Attribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of the three attribution types has multiple **attribution algorithms** associated with it. Many attribution algorithms fall into two broad categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Gradient-based algorithms** calculate the backward gradients of a model output, layer output, or neuron activation with respect to the input. **Integrated Gradients** (for features), **Layer Gradient * Activation**, and **Neuron Conductance** are all gradient-based algorithms.\n",
    "* **Perturbation-based algorithms** examine the changes in the output of a model, layer, or neuron in response to changes in the input. The input perturbations may be directed or random. **Occlusion,** **Feature Ablation,** and **Feature Permutation** are all perturbation-based algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be examining algorithms of both types below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Especially where large models are involved, it can be valuable to visualize attribution data in ways that relate it easily to the input features being examined. While it is certainly possible to create your own visualizations with Matplotlib, Plotly, or similar tools, Captum offers enhanced tools specific to its attributions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The `captum.attr.visualization` module (imported below as `viz`) provides helpful functions for visualizing attributions related to images.\n",
    "* **Captum Insights** is an easy-to-use API on top of Captum that provides a visualization widget with ready-made visualizations for image, text, and arbitrary model types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both of these visualization toolsets will be demonstrated in this notebook. The first few examples will focus on computer vision use cases, but the Captum Insights section at the end will demonstrate visualization of attributions in a multi-model, visual question-and-answer model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you get started, you need to have a Python environment with:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Python version 3.6 or higher\n",
    "* For the Captum Insights example, Flask 1.1 or higher\n",
    "* PyTorch version 1.2 or higher (the latest version is recommended)\n",
    "* TorchVision version 0.6 or higher (the latest version is recommended)\n",
    "* Captum (the latest version is recommended)\n",
    "\n",
    "To install Captum in an Anaconda or pip virtual environment, use the appropriate command for your environment below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda install captum -c pytorch\n",
    "pip install captum\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Restart this notebook in the environment you set up, and you're ready to go!"
