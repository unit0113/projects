# What is this?

This is a messy directory where I dumped scripts while trying to track down or reproduce bugs in the environment.

Mostly, you should ignore this directory. I just wanted to keep it around for anybody who was overly curious in how I created reproductions of some bugs.

# Bugs I dealt with

 * [Environment stops responding with high CPU usage](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/obstacle-tower-env/issues/77#issuecomment-480633857)
 * [The seed() function is broken](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/obstacle-tower-env/issues/91#issue-445758277)
 * [Cube stuck in the ground](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/obstacle-tower-env/issues/80)
