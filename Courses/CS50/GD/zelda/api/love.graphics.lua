---@class love.graphics
---The primary responsibility for the love.graphics module is the drawing of lines, shapes, text, Images and other Drawable objects onto the screen. Its secondary responsibilities include loading external files (including Images and Fonts) into memory, creating specialized objects (such as ParticleSystems or Canvases) and managing screen geometry.
---
---LÖVE's coordinate system is rooted in the upper-left corner of the screen, which is at location (0, 0). The x axis is horizontal: larger values are further to the right. The y axis is vertical: larger values are further towards the bottom.
---
---In many cases, you draw images or shapes in terms of their upper-left corner.
---
---Many of the functions are used to manipulate the graphics coordinate system, which is essentially the way coordinates are mapped to the display. You can change the position, scale, and even rotation in this way.

---Creates a new Quad.
---
---The purpose of a Quad is to describe the result of the following transformation on any drawable object. The object is first scaled to dimensions sw * sh.

---Following the mode argument, this function can accept multiple numeric arguments or a single table of numeric arguments. In either case the arguments are interpreted as alternating x and y coordinates of the polygon's vertices.
---
---When in fill mode, the polygon must be convex and simple or rendering artifacts may occur.
---@param mode DrawMode @How to draw the polygon.
---@param ... number @The vertices of the polygon.
---@overload fun(mode:DrawMode, vertices:table):void
function m.polygon(mode, ...) end

---Pops the current coordinate transformation from the transformation stack.
---

---Displays the results of drawing operations on the screen.
---
---This function is used when writing your own love.run function. It presents all the results of your drawing operations on the screen. See the example in love.run for a typical use of this function.
function m.present() end

---Draws text on screen. If no Font is set, one will be created and set (once) if needed.
---
---As of LOVE 0.7.1, when using translation and scaling functions while drawing text, this function assumes the scale occurs first. If you don't script with this in mind, the text won't be in the right position, or possibly even on screen.
---
---love.graphics.print and love.graphics.printf both support UTF-8 encoding. You'll also need a proper Font for special characters.
---@param text string @The text to draw.
---@param x number @The position to draw the object (x-axis).
---@param y number @The position to draw the object (y-axis).

---Draws formatted text, with word wrap and alignment.
---
---See additional notes in love.graphics.print.
---
---In version 0.9.2 and earlier, wrapping was implemented by breaking up words by spaces and putting them back together to make sure things fit nicely within the limit provided. However, due to the way this is done, extra spaces between words would end up missing when printed on the screen, and some lines could overflow past the provided wrap limit. In version 0.10.0 and newer this is no longer the case.
---@param text string @A text string.
---@param x number @The position on the x-axis.
---@param y number @The position on the y-axis.

function m.printf(text, x, y, limit, align, r, sx, sy, ox, oy, kx, ky) end

---Copies and pushes the current coordinate transformation to the transformation stack.
---
---This function is always used to prepare for a corresponding pop operation later. It stores the current coordinate transformation state into the transformation stack and keeps it active. Later changes to the transformation can be undone by using the pop operation, which returns the coordinate transform to the state it was in before calling push.
---@param stack StackType @The type of stack to push (e.g. just transformation state, or all love.graphics state).
function m.push(stack) end

---Draws a rectangle.
---@param mode DrawMode @How to draw the rectangle.

function m.rectangle(mode, x, y, width, height) end

---Resets the current graphics settings.
---
---Calling reset makes the current drawing color white, the current background color black, resets any active Canvas or Shader, and removes any scissor settings. It sets the BlendMode to alpha. It also sets both the point and line drawing modes to smooth and their sizes to 1.0.
function m.reset() end

---Rotates the coordinate system in two dimensions.
---
---Calling this function affects all future drawing operations by rotating the coordinate system around the origin by the given amount of radians. This change lasts until love.draw exits.
---@param angle number @The amount to rotate the coordinate system in radians.
function m.rotate(angle) end

---Scales the coordinate system in two dimensions.
---
---By default the coordinate system in LÖVE corresponds to the display pixels in horizontal and vertical directions one-to-one, and the x-axis increases towards the right while the y-axis increases downwards. Scaling the coordinate system changes this relation.
---
---After scaling by sx and sy, all coordinates are treated as if they were multiplied by sx and sy. Every result of a drawing operation is also correspondingly scaled, so scaling by (2, 2) for example would mean making everything twice as large in both x- and y-directions. Scaling by a negative value flips the coordinate system in the corresponding direction, which also means everything will be drawn flipped or upside down, or both. Scaling by zero is not a useful operation.
---
---Scale and translate are not commutative operations, therefore, calling them in different orders will change the outcome.
---
---Scaling lasts until love.draw exits.
---@param sx number @The scaling in the direction of the x-axis.
---@param sy number @The scaling in the direction of the y-axis. If omitted, it defaults to same as parameter sx.

---Sets the color used for drawing.
---@param red number @The amount of red.
---@param green number @The amount of green.

---@param alpha number @The amount of alpha. The alpha value will be applied to all subsequent draw operations, even the drawing of an image.
---@overload fun(rgba:table):void
function m.setColor(red, green, blue, alpha) end

---Sets the color mask. Enables or disables specific color components when rendering and clearing the screen. For example, if red is set to false, no further changes will be made to the red component of any pixels.
---
---Enables all color components when called without arguments.
---@param red boolean @Render red component.
---@param green boolean @Render green component.
---@param blue boolean @Render blue component.
---@param alpha boolean @Render alpha component.

---@param anisotropy number @Maximum amount of Anisotropic Filtering used.
function m.setDefaultFilter(min, mag, anisotropy) end

---Set an already-loaded Font as the current font or create and load a new one from the file and size.
---
---It's recommended that Font objects are created with love.graphics.newFont in the loading stage and then passed to this function in the drawing stage.
---@param font Font @The Font object to use.

---@overload fun(file:File, size:number):Font
---@overload fun(data:Data, size:number):Font

---@overload fun(shader:Shader):void
function m.setShader() end

---Sets the point size.
---@param size number @The new point size.
function m.setPointSize(size) end

---Sets or disables scissor.
---
---The scissor limits the drawing area to a specified rectangle. This affects all graphics calls, including love.graphics.clear.
---@param x number @The X coordinate of upper left corner.
---@param y number @The Y coordinate of upper left corner.
---@param width number @The width of clipping rectangle.
---@param height number @The height of clipping rectangle.
function m.setScissor(x, y, width, height) end

---Configures or disables stencil testing.
---
---When stencil testing is enabled, the geometry of everything that is drawn afterward will be clipped / stencilled out based on a comparison between the arguments of this function and the stencil value of each pixel that the geometry touches. The stencil values of pixels are affected via love.graphics.stencil.
---
---Each Canvas has its own per-pixel stencil values.
---@param comparemode CompareMode @The type of comparison to make for each pixel.
---@param comparevalue number @The value to use when comparing with the stencil value of each pixel. Must be between 0 and 255.
function m.setStencilTest(comparemode, comparevalue) end

---Sets whether wireframe lines will be used when drawing.
---
---Wireframe mode should only be used for debugging. The lines drawn with it enabled do not behave like regular love.graphics lines: their widths don't scale with the coordinate transformations or with love.graphics.setLineWidth, and they don't use the smooth LineStyle.
---@param enable boolean @True to enable wireframe mode when drawing, false to disable it.
function m.setWireframe(enable) end

---Shears the coordinate system.
---@param kx number @The shear factor on the x-axis.
---@param ky number @The shear factor on the y-axis.
function m.shear(kx, ky) end

---Draws geometry as a stencil.
---
---The geometry drawn by the supplied function sets invisible stencil values of pixels, instead of setting pixel colors. The stencil values of pixels can act like a mask / stencil - love.graphics.setStencilTest can be used afterward to determine how further rendering is affected by the stencil values in each pixel.
---
---Each Canvas has its own per-pixel stencil values. Stencil values are within the range of [0, 255].
---@param stencilfunction function @Function which draws geometry. The stencil values of pixels, rather than the color of each pixel, will be affected by the geometry.
---@param action StencilAction @How to modify any stencil values of pixels that are touched by what's drawn in the stencil function.
---@param value number @The new stencil value to use for pixels if the "replace" stencil action is used. Has no effect with other stencil actions. Must be between 0 and 255.
---@param keepvalues boolean @True to preserve old stencil values of pixels, false to re-set every pixel's stencil value to 0 before executing the stencil function. love.graphics.clear will also re-set all stencil values.
function m.stencil(stencilfunction, action, value, keepvalues) end

---Translates the coordinate system in two dimensions.
---
---When this function is called with two numbers, dx, and dy, all the following drawing operations take effect as if their x and y coordinates were x+dx and y+dy.
---
---Scale and translate are not commutative operations, therefore, calling them in different orders will change the outcome.
---
---This change lasts until love.graphics.clear is called (which is called automatically before love.draw in the default love.run function), or a love.graphics.pop reverts to a previous coordinate system state.
---
---Translating using whole numbers will prevent tearing/blurring of images and fonts draw after translating.
---@param dx number @The translation relative to the x-axis.
---@param dy number @The translation relative to the y-axis.
function m.translate(dx, dy) end
