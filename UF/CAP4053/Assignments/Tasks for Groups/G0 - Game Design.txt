A) Divide into teams of 3-5 people. Talk about your favorite simulations (including games) and their salient, impactful features / elements (setting, story line, characters, mechanics, audio / visuals / visceral elements).  Talk about what eras of computer technology, and what environmental design elements, play a major role in these simulations.

B) Develop a concept for a computer simulation. You may use features discussed earlier as guides, and/or you can develop entirely new ones. Sketch out the simulation's main features / elements. Put together a brief summary as a poster or slide(s).
