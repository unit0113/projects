.Sh SYNOPSIS             \" Section Header - required - don't modify
The purpose of
.Nm
is to build experience with command line usage and the available commands.
.Sh DESCRIPTION          \" Section Header - required - don't modify
Part 1 of 
.Nm
focused on file packaging, specifically the use of the following commands:
.Bl -tag -width -indent
.It Fl gzip
Used to zip a file or files
.It Fl gunzip
Used to unzip a .gz file
.It Fl tar
Used to create and extract .tar files. Can also be used to create .gz files from the tar files
.El
Part 2 of 
.Nm
focused on terminal navigation. It covered the use of the find command and how to pipe the output of a command into a file.
Part 2 concludes with the creation of this man page and extracting the files creating during the portion of
.Nm
using sftp.
.Sh FILES                \" File used or created by the topic of the man page
.Bl -tag -width -indent
.It Pa ex1.tar.gz
Zipped tar file of the directory created in part 2, includes output.txt
.It Pa ex1.txt
This man page
.El                      \" Ends the list
.Sh Part 2 Steps
.Bl -tag -width -indent

Use the mv command to move output.txt to the directory created in step 1
.It 5)
Use the tar command from part 1 to package the created directory and its contents

.Sh SEE ALSO
Far too many stack overflow threads were referenced to list individually. Most discussed steps 8-10 on part 1
(I was thrown off track when they mentioned piping, as I thought we were literally supposed to pipe the output of tar in gzip
and vice versa) and how to package a directory into a tar during part 2.
