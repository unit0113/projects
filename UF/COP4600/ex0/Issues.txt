The included install video was great and pretty much covered 100% of what I needed.
Only issue encountered was that at the very end of the video (when demonstrating snapshots)
when they closed out the VM there was an additional option in the video (Restore current snapshot "snapshot_name_here").
Had to spend a few minutes looking around to figure out how to restore the snapshot
(right click on the snapshot in virtualbox and click restore).
And that was it, everything else went really smoothly.
