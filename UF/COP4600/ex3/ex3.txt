The error message in GDB failed when executing the pthread_join function with a file not found error. Searching through process.c, in the loadSubRoutine function, there was a line referencing a memset function, which had a similar name to the missing file (it also had a suspicious comment above it). Commenting out this line of code resulted in a successful run of the program.
